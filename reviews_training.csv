2022-11-19,3,4,4,4,4,topics related to sources pools / performance / pipelines would make this Adkins training more fruitful. Donavan is great though.,Admin,Jonovan An,EMEA,Apple,FY23
2022-11-19,5,5,5,4,5,"I would request to gather real time problems from the customers and include them during course,  The real time problems would get from Singlestore support. The singlestore support team is the first front guys who knows or get weird questions from customers, Weird requirements from customers and understand and include them as one session in course content.  That way you can take few problems and explain solutions. Ex: i want to do switchover between Primary and Disaster recovery without rebuilding the database(i don't want to do drop database and execute replicate database), The singlestore handles terabyte data, The setting replicate database command may take more time, if any disaster occurs during execution of replicate command.., Think the situation without DR when real Disaster in place.. Thank you very much for the course and explanations. ",Admin,Jonovan An,EMEA,Apple,FY23

2022-07-21,5,5,5,5,5,"There wasn't a lot of time for labs, might be better to do live demos instead of having 5 minutes to copy the sql and paste it. It is still nice having the option to play around with the cluster though.",Dev,Jonovan An,EMEA,Impact,FY23
2022-07-21,5,4,5,4,5,"Too many of the ""knowledge check"" questions focused on tricky little wordings... would be better to focus on the actual content of the training, and not focus on tricky wordings, etc. 

For me personally, Day 2 was the highlight. Day 1 was a little abstract. Not sure if you could intermingle those contents a bit more so there was more hands-on in Day 1.",Dev,Jonovan An,EMEA,Impact,FY23
2022-07-21,5,5,5,5,5,"Learning about the structure of SingleStore's data (how it's stored, rowstore vs columnstore, memory vs disk vs object store, shard keys, etc.) was SUPER beneficial. Also the bits about visual profiling was very helpful and will aid in our own self diagnostic of bad queries/schemas.

There was a lot of slides on the topics of JSON and geospatial data. Though interesting and helpful, these features will likely not be used too extensively in our organization. But I suppose, now that we know about them we can potentially use them for future features :)",Dev,Jonovan An,EMEA,Impact,FY23

2022-07-21,5,4,5,4,3,"These sessions covered a boatload of content which gave me a good idea of capabilities overall, but going through the labs again at my own pace will be required to cement in the knowledge. 

We had a pretty diverse group in the session which makes it hard to pitch it at exactly the right level, I feel like this led some participants to fade into the background a bit as more experienced team members were clearly more vocal and engaged.

Good mix of theoretical and practical in the content. More ""advanced"" labs and use cases as additional extras would definitely be worthwhile to go through in self-paced learning.

I understand this is the developer track, but I would have enjoyed a bit more focus on extracting and analysing data - practical use cases and case studies of analytical challenges and how to solve them in SingleStore would be really useful too. 

Big missing topic for me was Common Table Expressions (CTEs), SubQueries, Temporary tables and analytical functions - how they interact with the Query Optimizer and how they can be leveraged to optimize inefficient queries or change query execution plans.

Some of the labs did touch on topics that were not yet covered or introduced in the content leading up to it, but these were infrequent and not too bothersome; they did leave me needing to click the dreaded ""solution"" button.

As a whole a good experience - unlikely that I would have been able to cover this much content during solo self-paced learning in even double the amount of time.",Dev,Jonovan An,EMEA,Impact,FY23
